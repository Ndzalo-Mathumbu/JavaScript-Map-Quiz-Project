# JavaScript-Map-Quiz-Project

> A concise practice project where I explored JavaScriptâ€™s `Map` object to build a little interactive quiz, handle user input, and experiment with map iteration and conversion.

## Overview

- Presents a simple question: **"What is the best programming language in the world?"**
- Displays possible answers stored as numeric keys inside a `Map`.
- Prompts the user for input and checks correctness dynamically.
- Converts the `Map` into arrays to demonstrate iterable methods.
- Iterates over keys, values, and entries, logging them to the console.

This project helped me understand:
- `Map` creation and use cases.
- Conditional rendering from maps.
- Converting maps to arrays (`[...map]`).
- Using `.entries()`, `.keys()`, and `.values()`.
